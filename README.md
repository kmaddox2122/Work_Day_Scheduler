#### Main Take-away: 

This project provided an opportunity to practice the Javascript and jQuery learned during our lessons. It has been helpful to learn more of each language and apply them in a new way.

### Goals for this project:
    My goal for this project was to practice and understand more fully the fundamentals of JavaScript and jQuery.

### What I did:
    -I created an HTML template
    -I created a .js file 
        -wrote out pseudocode for project
        -established variables
        -used Moment to pull current date
        -wrote a 'for' loop to determine the backgroung color of each text field
        -created functions to save to then pull from local storage.
    -I created a .css file and applied styling to HTML page

### What I learned:
    Through this project, I have been able to practice the fundamentals of JavaScript and jQuery to better understand the languages. With more time I would:
    -correct the current time block to show a red background.
    -polish the page using CSS
    -add a 'reset all' feature to clear all text fields
